# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-AI-Classification

Explanation: 
This AI Project implements a Feedforward Neural Networks to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer 
My approach starts by importing Python's sklearn.model_selection module 
so that we can split our dataset into training and testing sets into 80:20% 
and we can later cross-validate our model for accuracy. 
I also used the open-source tf from TensorFlowâ€™s API which is good for numerical computations and ML
